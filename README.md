# California-housing---ML-Project
This is an end-to-end machine learning project. this project starts from loading the data, visualizing it, fill in the missing values, create pipelines, handle categorical variables, train models based on that data, and finally predict using that model.  This does not only help me to understand how to train a machine learning model, but also give me a detailed idea of how to clean and prepare data for machine learning, train the model, and fine tune it in real life projects.  Happy learning!!!
